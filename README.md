# Book Search Engine
Challenge 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## Description

For this project, I took a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This is a MERN stack app and it is deployed with heroku.

Once a user is logged in, they can search for books and click the 'Save this Book!' button to save a book.<br>
To view their list of books, users can click 'See Your Books' in the navigation bar to view their list.
